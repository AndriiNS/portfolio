          My name is Andrii. I was born on 10 March 2005 in Ukraine. I have a complete secondary
          education and am currently studying at Khmelnytskyi National University, Department of
          Information Technology.

          I've been studying website development for about 2 years now, and I love doing it because
          you always learn something new and you're always developing. I haven't had a permanent job
          in this field, but I have done a few custom websites. As I study at the Department of
          Information Technology, I tried different languages, I worked with database, PHP, JS, C,
          but I can't say that I have any good knowledge of these languages. I'm learning JS, but I
          don't know it well, but I can do things like sliders or pagination and something not too
          difficult.
          <br />
          <br />
          My strengths are adapting to something new, being positive, having good communication
          skills and a good knowledge of English. I plan to try to pass an English test and get a C1
          certificate in the near future.

          I am fond of sports, if we talk about what I have done and will do most of all, it is folk
          dancing. I've been dancing for over 12 years and I really enjoy it. I also love football
          and volleyball, they are some of my favourite sports. And of course I like video games, I
          think that almost everyone who works with computers should like video games. And maybe for
          some people it will be an unnecessary fact, but I study on tuition-free.
