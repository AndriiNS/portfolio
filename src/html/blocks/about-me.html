          My name is Andrii. I was born on 10 March 2005 in Ukraine. I have a complete secondary
          education and am currently studying at Khmelnytskyi National University, Department of
          Information Technology.

          I've been studying website development for about 2 years now, and I love doing it because
          you always learn something new and you're always developing. I haven't had a permanent job
          in this field, but I have done a few custom websites. As I study at the Department of
          Information Technology, I have tried different languages. I have worked with databases,
          PHP, and C, but I have only worked with these languages at university. I am currently
          learning JavaScript, and very soon I want to start learning React. Pagination, sliders,
          tabs, and other things are not a problem for me.
          <br />
          <br />
          My strengths include adapting to new situations, maintaining a positive attitude,
          possessing good communication skills, and having a good understanding of English.
          Currently, my English level is B2, but I am planning to take an English test soon to
          obtain a C1 certificate.

          And maybe for some people it will be an unnecessary fact, but I study on tuition-free. I
          am fond of sports, if we talk about what I have done and will do most of all, it is folk
          dancing. I've been dancing for over 12 years and I really enjoy it. I also love football
          and volleyball, they are some of my favourite sports. And of course I like video games, I
          think that almost everyone who works with computers should like video games.
