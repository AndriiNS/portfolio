          Usually, my projects are ordinary landing pages in which I use different approaches. For
          example, I often use <span class="green"> JS, JQuerry, Swiper, Scrollreveal</span>, and I
          also started learning animation with gsap. I also have
          <span class="green">no problems with the adaptive</span>, I think I've got it down well.

        <p class="projects__info-text">
          In general, in every project I do, I come across something new and try to learn it so that
          it will be easier to do similar tasks in the future.In this project, for example, I learnt
          how to animate svg icons and how to work with gsap.

          This project is currently the last one I made before this portfolio. The whole project is
          built on sliders and various hover effects. Also in this project there is an adaptive and
          <span class="green">active 3 pages (news, about us, contacts)</span>. In the future, I'm
          thinking of adding more interactivity to my sites and want to learn the back-end. I know
          that with good knowledge of front-end and back-end, you can make great websites.

            All the other projects I've done are just ordinary pages where you might find something
            interesting. I try to choose website designs that have a responsive design, but most of
            the sites I've done were not responsive, so I used my imagination and tried to make
            something similar to it.

            In general, I can't say that these projects are bad or not good, in my opinion, I also
            got some useful knowledge and skills from these projects.

            has the sites you can see in this portfolio, but there are a few more interesting sites
            there, such as <span class="green">"dimano"</span>,
            <span class="green">"logoipsum"</span> and a few more. They are simple, but they also
            look good.
